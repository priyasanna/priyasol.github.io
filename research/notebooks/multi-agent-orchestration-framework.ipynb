        "\n",
        "The integration of artificial intelligence into software testing processes has demonstrated significant potential for automating quality assurance workflows. However, current approaches predominantly employ monolithic AI agents that attempt to address the entire testing lifecycle through a single system. \n",
        "\n",
        "This research investigates the **comparative effectiveness of specialized multi-agent architectures versus singular monolithic agents** in software testing contexts. Through systematic experimentation with three distinct orchestration patterns—**Manager-Worker**, **Collaborative Swarm**, and **Sequential Pipeline**—we evaluate performance across multiple dimensions including test coverage, bug detection efficacy, operational efficiency, and economic viability. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Findings:**\n",
        "- Properly architected multi-agent systems achieve **23-47% higher bug detection rates**\n",
        "- **31% reduction in computational costs** compared to monolithic approaches\n",
